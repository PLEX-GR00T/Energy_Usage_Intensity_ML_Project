# Tabular Data Processing with different models.
1) Perform Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) and connect with BigQuery and utilize Data Studio.
2) Accelerate the model training.
3) Perform Different Models. 

## 1) EDA and Data Studio
- Upload the Dataset to the BigQuery with subscription given by professor.
- You can find my Exploratory Data Analysis [here](https://github.com/PLEX-GR00T/Machine_Learning/blob/main/BigQuery_with_EDA.ipynb).
- The visulization of the live dashboard with Data Studio is below.
